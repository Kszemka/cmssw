Introduction to CMSSW: http://cms-sw.github.io

This branch concerns the new TOTEM T2 detector for Run 3, specifically the part for reconstruction real data; see 
(on GitHub) forthommel:nt2_reco_and_simu-12_5_X for simulation and reconstruction, and forthommel:nt2_reco-12_4_X for some 
online DQM (data quality monitor) plots for T2, under DQM/CTPPS. 

You can test it on CC8 / lxplus8.cern.ch , which is the expected production version for CMSSW 12_5

1. Make a project area with the latest version of 12_5 (12_5_0_pre3 as of this writing)
 "cmsrel CMSSW_12_5_0_pre3"
 If this fails, it may be due to the gcc version setting being outdated; try:
  "scram list CMSSW|grep 12_5" , and then "export $SCRAM_ARCH=el8_amd64_gcc10"
  2. "cd CMSSW_12_5_0_pre3/src" & "cmsenv", to be able to run the code in this project area with "cmsRun" command etc.
  3. "git cms-init", to be able to use cms-specific git commands in the project area; you need to add some GitHub account info here,
  see the CMSSW and GitHub section of the Introduction to CMSSW above.
  4. Add a remote and switch to this branch: 
   "git remote add oljemark https://github.com/oljemark/cmssw.git" & "git fetch oljemark" & "git checkout nt2_reco_onlyS-12_5_X"
   Replace "oljemark" with "forthommel" to access the other branches noted above.
  5. Rebase with the version of CMSSW you are presently using & commit the branch to your GitHub profile, or somewhere else:
   "git checkout -b yourbranchname" & "git rebase -i from-CMSSW_12_5_0_pre3" (exit text editor) & "git push my-cmssw yourbranchname"
  6. Your project area is in a sparse checkout state: to test the T2 code, add the following directories with "git cms-addpkg -f mylist.txt" :
   CalibPPS/ESProducers
   CondFormats/PPSObjects
   DataFormats/CTPPSDetId
   DataFormats/FEDRawData
   DataFormats/TotemReco
   EventFilter/CTPPSRawToDigi
   Geometry/ForwardGeometry
   Geometry/Records
   Geometry/VeryForwardGeometryBuilder
   RecoPPS/Local
  7. Compile the code: "scram b -j 8"
  8. Try out T2 reconstruction with a test file based on Run 2 PPS diamond detector data: 
   "cd RecoPPS/Local/test" & "cmsRun totemT2_reco_cfg.py". This fails on 12_5_0_pre3 due to PR https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/38366
   , but works on 12_5_0_pre2, to be fixed.
  9. At present, try it in 12_5_0_pre2, with branch forthommel:nt2_reco_and_simu-12_5_X ; to be able to read the Run 2 data file, 
   a CMS GRID certificate is necessary, see: https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/WorkBookStartingGrid#ObtainingCert
   and https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideLcgAccess
   After getting the certificate and registering in the cms VOMS, make a proxy weekly with
   "voms-proxy-init --rfc --voms cms -valid 192:00"
